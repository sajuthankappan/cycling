I, along with 7-8 friends from WCCG, reached the venue by car pooling.

Ride started from Ciclo Cafe around 5:15 in the morning. I missed all my co-riders/friends at the start point itself, as all of them are much faster riders than me ðŸ˜…

Anyway, riding solo is my strong point, and I started riding in my own speed. There were good/heavy headwinds till Mahabs & hence couldn't ride with much speed. Could have done between 15-25kmph. Saw Arun & Srikanth, taking rest, a few kms before Mahabs. It was almost a non-stop ride for me, till I reached Mahabs. The pitstop at Mahabs had refreshments, which includes water, banana, etc. Met Rajendran, who was also taking a rest there. Drank enough water; had a couple of bananas and started ridng back after spending 5 minutes at the u turn point. 

Return ride was comparatively much easier with tail winds all the way. At some points, my foldie was riding 32-34+kmph, and I was running out of gear and spinning a lot in my Foldie! 

Again, pretty much a non-stop ride, except took a minute break for a sugar cane juice ðŸ˜€

Reached Ciclo Cafe back around 8:30. So, 4 hours 15 minutes for 100kms. I think my personal best, for 100kms at a speed of 23kmph.
Had free breakfast at Ciclo Cafe. Breakfast was good. You may not like it if you are only used to typical Indian breakfast ðŸ˜‰

Overall, another pleasant solo ride, with a slighly higher speed than my usual speed, with minimal breaks. Let me see when I can hit a sub 4 hours 100k!
