CICLOTHON – BEAT YOUR PERSONAL BEST!

Ciclo Cafe has become synonymous with cycling in the bustling city of Chennai over these two years at Kotturpuram. The journey has been wonderful and we have shown that cycling is not just a theme for us, but also a huge part of our lifestyle. In light of that, and in association with Track&Trail, 2Go and Fast N Up, we present the Ciclothon - a unique cycling event that focuses on celebrating every finisher. 

With groups of pacers at different speeds, all you have to do is stick with the group of your choice and you will finish with a personal record. 
The number does not matter, the speed does not matter. Is it your best? That's all matters!
